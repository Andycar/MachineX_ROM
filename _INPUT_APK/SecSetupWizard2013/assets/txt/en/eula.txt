End User Licence Agreement for Software

IMPORTANT. READ CAREFULLY: This End User Licence Agreement (“EULA”) is a legal agreement between you (either an individual or a single entity) and Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. (“Samsung”) for software, owned by Samsung and its affiliated companies and its third party suppliers and licensors, that accompanies this EULA, which includes computer software and may include associated media, printed materials, “online” or electronic documentation in connection with your use of this device (“Software”).  
This device requires the use of preloaded software in its normal operation.  BY USING THE DEVICE OR ITS PRELOADED SOFTWARE, YOU ACCEPT THE TERMS OF THIS EULA.  IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THESE TERMS, DO NOT USE THE DEVICE OR THE SOFTWARE.  

1. GRANT OF LICENCE.  Samsung grants you the following rights provided that you comply with all the terms and conditions of this EULA: You may install, use, access, display and run one copy of the Software on the local hard disk(s) or other permanent storage media of one computer and use the Software on a single computer or a mobile device at any one time, and you may not make the Software available over a network where it could be used by multiple computers at the same time. You may make one copy of the Software in machine‑readable form for backup purposes only; provided that the backup copy must include all copyright or other proprietary notices contained on the original.

Certain items of the Software may be subject to open source licences.  The open source licence provisions may override some of the terms of this EULA.  We make the applicable open source licences available to you on the Legal Notices section of the Settings menu of your device.

2. RESERVATION OF RIGHTS AND OWNERSHIP.  Samsung reserves all rights not expressly granted to you in this EULA. The Software is protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws and treaties. Samsung or its suppliers own the title, copyright and other intellectual property rights in the Software. The Software is licensed, not sold.

3. LIMITATIONS ON END USER RIGHTS.  You may not reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or otherwise attempt to discover the source code or algorithms of, the Software (except and only to the extent that such activity is expressly permitted by applicable law notwithstanding this limitation), or modify, or disable any features of, the Software, or create derivative works based on the Software. You may not rent, lease, lend, sublicense or provide commercial hosting services with the Software.

4. CONSENT TO USE OF DATA.  You agree that Samsung and its affiliates may collect and use technical information gathered as part of the product support services related to the Software provided to you, if any, such as your IMEI (your device's unique identification number), device number, model name, customer code, access recording, your device's current SW version, MCC (Mobile Country Code), MNC (Mobile Network Code). Samsung and its affiliates may use this information solely to improve their products or to provide customized services or technologies to you and will not disclose this information in a form that personally identifies you.  At all times your information will be treated in accordance with Samsung’s Privacy Policy, which can be viewed at: http://account.samsung.com/membership/pp.

5. SOFTWARE UPDATES. Samsung may provide to you or make available to you updates, upgrades, supplements and add-on components (if any) of the Software, including bug fixes, service upgrades (parts or whole), products or devices, and updates and enhancements to any software previously installed (including entirely new versions), (collectively “Update”) after the date you obtain your initial copy of the Software to improve the Software and ultimately enhance your user experience with your device. This EULA applies to all and any component of the Update that Samsung may provide to you or make available to you after the date you obtain your initial copy of the Software, unless we provide other terms along with such Update. To use Software provided through Update, you must first be licensed for the Software identified by Samsung as eligible for the Update. After the Update, you may no longer use the Software that formed the basis for your Update eligibility. The updated Software version may add new functions and, in some limited cases, may delete existing functions.

While the Update will be generally available, in some limited circumstances, the Software updates will only be offered by your network carrier, and such Software updates will be governed by your contractual relationship with your network carrier.

With the “Automatic Update” function enabled (as in the default setting in the System Update menu or Security menu in the Setting), your device downloads some Updates automatically from time to time. Your device will, however, ask for your consent before installing any Update. However, given the importance of receiving Updates for security software in a timely manner to defend against new threats, such Update may be automatically downloaded and installed. We recommend that you check availability of any new Updates periodically for optimal use of your device. If you want to avoid any use of network data for the Update downloads, then you should choose the “Wi-Fi Only” option in the Setting.

6. Some features of the Software may require your device to have access to the internet and may be subject to restrictions imposed by your network or internet provider.  Unless your device is connected to the internet through a Wi-Fi connection, the Software will access it through your mobile network, which may result in additional charges depending on your payment plan.  In addition, your enjoyment of some features of the Software may be affected by the suitability and performance of your device hardware or data access. 

7. SOFTWARE TRANSFER.  You may not transfer this EULA or the rights to the Software granted herein to any third party unless it is in connection with the sale of the mobile device which the Software accompanied. In such event, the transfer must include all of the Software (including all component parts, the media and printed materials, any upgrades, and this EULA) and you may not retain any copies of the Software. The transfer may not be an indirect transfer, such as a consignment. Prior to the transfer, the end user receiving the Software must agree to all the EULA terms.

8. EXPORT RESTRICTIONS.  You acknowledge that the Software is subject to export restrictions of various countries. You agree to comply with all applicable international and national laws that apply to the Software, including all the applicable export restriction laws and regulations.   

9. TERMINATION.  This EULA is effective until terminated. Your rights under this Licence will terminate automatically without notice from Samsung if you fail to comply with any of the terms and conditions of this EULA. Upon termination of this EULA, you must cease all use of the Software and destroy all copies, full or partial, of the Software.

10. Disclaimer of Warranty.  UNLESS SEPARATELY STATED IN A WRITTEN EXPRESS LIMITED WARRANTY ACCOMPANYING YOUR DEVICE, ALL SOFTWARE PROVIDED BY SAMSUNG WITH THIS MOBILE DEVICE (WHETHER INCLUDED WITH THE DEVICE, DOWNLOADED, OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED)  IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND ON AN “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND FROM SAMSUNG, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED.

SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW EXCLUSIONS OR LIMITATIONS OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSIONS OR LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM SAMSUNG OR ITS AFFILIATES SHALL BE DEEMED TO ALTER THIS DISCLAIMER BY SAMSUNG OF WARRANTY REGARDING THE SOFTWARE, OR TO CREATE ANY WARRANTY OF ANY SORT FROM SAMSUNG. 

11. THIRD-PARTY APPLICATIONS.  Certain third‑party applications may be included with, or downloaded to this mobile device. Samsung makes no representations whatsoever about any of these applications. Since Samsung has no control over such applications, you acknowledge and agree that Samsung is not responsible for the availability of such applications and is not responsible or liable for any content, advertising, products, services, or other materials on or available from such applications. You expressly acknowledge and agree that use of third‑party applications is at your sole risk and that the entire risk of unsatisfactory quality, performance, accuracy and effort is with you.

You agree that Samsung shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss, including but not limited to any damage to the mobile device or loss of data, caused or alleged to be caused by, or in connection with, use of or reliance on any such third‑party content, products, or services available on or through any such application. You acknowledge and agree that the use of any third-party application is governed by such third‑party application provider’s Terms of Use, Licence Agreement, Privacy Policy, or other such agreement and that any information or personal data you provide, whether knowingly or unknowingly, to such third-party application provider, will be subject to such third‑party application provider’s privacy policy, if such a policy exists. SAMSUNG DISCLAIMS ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION OR ANY OTHER PRACTICE OF ANY THIRD‑PARTY APPLICATION PROVIDER. SAMSUNG EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTY REGARDING WHETHER YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION IS CAPTURED BY ANY THIRD‑PARTY APPLICATION PROVIDER OR THE USE TO WHICH SUCH PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE PUT BY SUCH THIRD‑PARTY APPLICATION PROVIDER.

12. SAMSUNG APPLICATIONS.   Certain Samsung applications and services may be included with, or downloaded to, this mobile device.  Many of them require Samsung Services membership registration (a “Samsung Account”), and your rights and obligations will be set forth in separate Samsung Account terms and conditions and privacy policies.  There are non-Samsung Account applications and services that require your consent to their separate terms and conditions and privacy policies.  You expressly acknowledge and agree that your use of such applications and services will be subject to the applicable terms and conditions and privacy policies.

13. Limitation of Liability.  SAMSUNG WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES OF ANY KIND ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE USE OF OR THE INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE OR ANY THIRD‑PARTY APPLICATION, ITS CONTENT OR FUNCTIONALITY, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO DAMAGES CAUSED BY OR RELATED TO ERRORS, OMISSIONS, INTERRUPTIONS, DEFECTS, DELAY IN OPERATION OR TRANSMISSION, COMPUTER VIRUS, FAILURE TO CONNECT, NETWORK CHARGES, IN-APP PURCHASES, AND ALL OTHER DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES EVEN IF SAMSUNG HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSIONS OR LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, SAMSUNG ELECTRONICS CO.’S TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ALL LOSSES, DAMAGES, CAUSES OF ACTION, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THOSE BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, ARISING OUT OF YOUR USE OF THE SOFTWARE OR THIRD‑PARTY APPLICATIONS ON THIS MOBILE DEVICE, OR ANY OTHER PROVISION OF THIS EULA, SHALL NOT EXCEED THE SPECIFIC AMOUNT THE PURCHASER PAID FOR THIS MOBILE DEVICE OR ANY SUCH THIRD‑PARTY APPLICATION THAT WAS INCLUDED WITH THIS MOBILE DEVICE. THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS, EXCLUSIONS, AND DISCLAIMERS (INCLUDING SECTIONS 10, 11, 12 AND 13) SHALL APPLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, EVEN IF ANY REMEDY FAILS ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

14. APPLICABLE LAW.  This EULA is governed by the laws of the jurisdiction where you are a resident, without regard to any conflict of law provisions. This EULA shall not be governed by the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, the application of which is expressly excluded. 

15. DISPUTE RESOLUTION.  
If a dispute, controversy or difference of opinion arising in any way from this EULA or your use of the Software is not amicably settled, it shall be subject to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the jurisdiction where you are a resident.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Samsung may apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in any jurisdiction. 

16. ENTIRE AGREEMENT; SEVERABILITY. This EULA is the entire agreement between you and Samsung relating to the Software and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral or written communications, proposals and representations with respect to the Software or any other subject matter covered by this EULA. If any provision of this EULA is held to be void, invalid, unenforceable or illegal, the other provisions shall continue in full force and effect.
