Turning location “ON” will allow U.S. Cellular to track the location of this handset and share such information with third party providers of location-based services. Once this handset’s location information is transferred from U.S. Cellular to the third-party location-based service provider, that third party’s privacy policy will govern subsequent uses of your location information. You should carefully review the terms and conditions and associated privacy policy of each such location- based service for information regarding how the third party provider of that service will use, disclose, protect and retain your location information. Such uses may include, but not be limited to, offering you location-based promotions and sharing your location with others. U.S. Cellular uses a variety of commercially reasonable and appropriate safeguards to protect location information residing on our systems from unauthorized access or disclosure including, without limitation, server firewalls and physical facility security. We also restrict access to location information to only those work groups that need to know that information for their job function. No security is perfect, however, and U.S. Cellular cannot guarantee the security of your location information. U.S. Cellular does not guaranty the accuracy or completeness of location information delivered through its network, and any location-based service may be disrupted or fail due to environmental factors and factors affecting satellite usage.
