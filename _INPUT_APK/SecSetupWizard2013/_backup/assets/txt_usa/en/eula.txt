End User License Agreement for Software

IMPORTANT. READ CAREFULLY: This End User License Agreement (“EULA”) is a legal agreement between you (either an individual or a single entity) and Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. (“Samsung”) for software, owned by Samsung and its affiliated companies and its third party suppliers and licensors, that accompanies this EULA, which includes computer software and may include associated media, printed materials, “online” or electronic documentation in connection with your use of this device (“Software”).  

This device requires the use of preloaded software in its normal operation.  BY USING THE DEVICE OR ITS PRELOADED SOFTWARE, YOU ACCEPT THE TERMS OF THIS EULA.  IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THESE TERMS, DO NOT USE THE DEVICE OR THE SOFTWARE. 

1. GRANT OF LICENSE.  Samsung grants you the following rights provided that you comply with all terms and conditions of this EULA: You may install, use, access, display and run one copy of the Software on the local hard disk(s) or other permanent storage media of one computer and use the Software on a single computer or a mobile device at a time, and you may not make the Software available over a network where it could be used by multiple computers at the same time. You may make one copy of the Software in machine readable form for backup purposes only; provided that the backup copy must include all copyright or other proprietary notices contained on the original.

Certain items of the Software may be subject to open source licenses.  The open source license provisions may override some of the terms of this EULA.  We make the applicable open source licenses available to you on the Legal Notices section of the Settings menu of your device. 
2. RESERVATION OF RIGHTS AND OWNERSHIP.  Samsung reserves all rights not expressly granted to you in this EULA. The Software is protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws and treaties. Samsung or its suppliers own the title, copyright and other intellectual property rights in the Software. The Software is licensed, not sold.

3. LIMITATIONS ON END USER RIGHTS.  You may not reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or otherwise attempt to discover the source code or algorithms of, the Software (except and only to the extent that such activity is expressly permitted by applicable law not withstanding this limitation), or modify, or disable any features of, the Software, or create derivative works based on the Software. You may not rent, lease, lend, sublicense or provide commercial hosting services with the Software.

4. CONSENT TO USE OF DATA.  You agree that Samsung and its affiliates may collect and use technical information gathered as part of the product support services related to the Software provided to you, if any, such as IMEI(your device's unique identification number), device number, model name, customer code, access recording, your device's current SW version, MCC (Mobile Country Code), MNC (Mobile Network Code). Samsung and its affiliates may use this information solely to improve their products or to provide customized services or technologies to you and will not disclose this information in a form that personally identifies you.  At all times your information will be treated in accordance with Samsung’s Privacy Policy, which can be viewed at: http://account.samsung.com/membership/pp.

5. SOFTWARE UPDATES. Samsung may provide to you or make available to you updates, upgrades, supplements, and add-on components (if any) of the Software, including bug fixes, service upgrades (parts or whole), products or devices, and updates and enhancements to any software previously installed (including entirely new versions), (collectively “Update”) after the date you obtain your initial copy of the Software to improve the Software and ultimately enhance your user experience with your device. This EULA applies to all and any component of the Update that Samsung may provide to you or make available to you after the date you obtain your initial copy of the Software, unless we provide other terms along with such Updates. To use Software provided through Update, you must first be licensed for the Software identified by Samsung as eligible for the Update. After the Update, you may no longer use the Software that formed the basis for your Update eligibility. The updated Software version may add new functions and, in some limited cases, may delete existing functions.

While the Update will be generally available, in some limited circumstances, the Software Updates will only be offered by your network carrier, and such Software Updates will be governed by your contractual relationship with your network carrier.

With the “Automatic Update” function enabled (as in the default setting in the System Update menu or Security menu in the Settings), your device downloads some Updates automatically from time to time. Your device will, in most cases, ask for your consent before installing any Update. However, given the importance of receiving timely Updates for security software to defend against new threats, such Updates may be automatically downloaded and installed. For optimal use of your device, we recommend that you periodically check whether any new Updates are available. If you want to avoid any use of network data for the Update downloads, then you should choose the “Wi-Fi Only” option in the Settings.

6.  Some features of the Software may require your device to have access to the internet and may be subject to restrictions imposed by your network or internet provider.  Unless your device is connected to the internet through Wi-Fi connection, the Software will access through your mobile network, which may result in additional charges depending on your payment plan.  In addition, your enjoyment of some features of the Software may be affected by the suitability and performance of your device hardware or data access. 

7. SOFTWARE TRANSFER.  You may not transfer this EULA or the rights to the Software granted herein to any third party unless it is in connection with the sale of the mobile device which the Software accompanied. In such event, the transfer must include all of the Software (including all component parts, the media and printed materials, any upgrades, this EULA) and you may not retain any copies of the Software. The transfer may not be an indirect transfer, such as a consignment. Prior to the transfer, the end user receiving the Software must agree to all the EULA terms.

8. EXPORT RESTRICTIONS.  You acknowledge that the Software is subject to export restrictions of various countries. You agree to comply with all applicable international and national laws that apply to the Software, including all the applicable export restriction laws and regulations.   

9. TERMINATION.  This EULA is effective until terminated. Your rights under this EULA will terminate automatically without notice from Samsung if you fail to comply with any of the terms and conditions of this EULA. Upon termination of this EULA, you must cease all use of the Software and destroy all copies, full or partial, of the Software.

You expressly acknowledge and agree that your use of such applications and services will be subject to the applicable terms and conditions and privacy policies.

13. Limitation of Liability.  SAMSUNG WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES OF ANY KIND ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE USE OR THE INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE OR ANY THIRD PARTY APPLICATION, ITS CONTENT OR FUNCTIONALITY, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO DAMAGES CAUSED BY OR RELATED TO ERRORS, OMISSIONS, INTERRUPTIONS, DEFECTS, DELAY IN OPERATION OR TRANSMISSION, COMPUTER VIRUS, FAILURE TO CONNECT, NETWORK CHARGES, IN-APP PURCHASES, AND ALL OTHER DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES EVEN IF SAMSUNG HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSIONS OR LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, SAMSUNG ELECTRONIC CO.’S TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ALL LOSSES, DAMAGES, CAUSES OF ACTION, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THOSE BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, ARISING OUT OF YOUR USE OF THE SOFTWARE OR THIRD PARTY APPLICATIONS ON THIS MOBILE DEVICE, OR ANY OTHER PROVISION OF THIS EULA, SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT PURCHASER PAID SPECIFICALLY FOR THIS MOBILE DEVICE OR ANY SUCH THIRD PARTY APPLICATION THAT WAS INCLUDED WITH THIS MOBILE DEVICE.

15. APPLICABLE LAW.  This EULA is governed by the laws of the jurisdiction where you are a resident or, if a resident of the United States, by the laws of the state of Texas,, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. This EULA shall not be governed by the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, the application of which is expressly excluded. 

16.  DISPUTE RESOLUTION.  
(a) Non-United States residents.  If a dispute, controversy or difference arising in any way from this EULA or your use of the Software is not amicably settled, it shall be subject to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the jurisdiction where you are a resident.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Samsung may apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in any jurisdiction. 
(b) United States residents.  ALL DISPUTES WITH SAMSUNG ARISING IN ANY WAY FROM THIS EULA OR YOUR USE OF THE SOFTWARE SHALL BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY THROUGH FINAL AND BINDING ARBITRATION, AND NOT BY A COURT OR JURY.  Any such dispute shall not be combined or consolidated with any other person’s or entity’s claim or dispute, and specifically, without limitation of the foregoing, shall not under any circumstances proceed as part of a class action. The arbitration shall be conducted before a single arbitrator, whose award may not exceed, in form or amount, the relief allowed by the applicable law. The arbitration shall be conducted according to the American Arbitration Association (AAA) Commercial Arbitration Rules applicable to consumer disputes. This arbitration provision is entered pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act. The laws of the State of Texas, without reference to its choice of laws principles, shall govern the interpretation of the EULA and all disputes that are subject to this arbitration provision. The arbitrator shall decide all issues of interpretation and application of this arbitration provision and the EULA.  For any arbitration in which your total damage claims, exclusive of attorney fees and expert witness fees, are $5,000.00 or less (“Small Claim”), the arbitrator may, if you prevail, award your reasonable attorney fees, expert witness fees and costs as part of any award, but may not grant Samsung its attorney fees, expert witness fees or costs unless it is determined that the claim was brought in bad faith. In a Small Claim case, you shall be required to pay no more than half of the total administrative, facility and arbitrator fees, or $50.00 of such fees, whichever is less, and Samsung shall pay the remainder of such fees. Administrative, facility and arbitrator fees for arbitrations in which your total damage claims, exclusive of attorney fees and expert witness fees, exceed $5,000.00 (“Large Claim”) shall be determined according to AAA rules. In a Large Claim case, the arbitrator may grant to the prevailing party, or apportion among the parties, reasonable attorney fees, expert witness fees and costs. Judgment may be entered on the arbitrator’s award in any court of competent jurisdiction.  This arbitration provision also applies to claims against Samsung’s employees, representatives and affiliates if any such claim arises from the licensing or use of the Software.  You may opt out of this dispute resolution procedure by providing notice to Samsung no later than 30 calendar days from the date of the first consumer purchaser’s purchase of this device. To opt out, you must send notice by e-mail to optout@sta.samsung.com, with the subject line: “Arbitration Opt Out.” You must include in the opt out e-mail (a) your name and address; (b) the date on which the device was purchased; (c) the device model name or model number; and (d) the IMEI or MEID or Serial Number, as applicable, if you have it (the IMEI or MEID or Serial Number can be found (i) on the device box; (ii) on the device information screen, which can be found under “Settings;” (iii) on a label on the back of the device beneath the battery, if the battery is removable; and (iv) on the outside of the device if the battery is not removable). Alternatively, you may opt out by calling 1-888-987-4357 no later than 30 calendar days from the date of the first consumer purchaser’s purchase of the device and providing the same information. These are the only two forms of notice that will be effective to opt out of this dispute resolution procedure.  Opting out of this dispute resolution procedure will not affect your use of the device or its preloaded Software, and you will continue to enjoy the benefits of this license.

17.  ENTIRE AGREEMENT; SEVERABILITY. This EULA is the entire agreement between you and Samsung relating to the Software and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral or written communications, proposals and representations with respect to the Software or any other subject matter covered by this EULA. If any provision of this EULA is held to be void, invalid, unenforceable or illegal, the other provisions shall continue in full force and effect.
