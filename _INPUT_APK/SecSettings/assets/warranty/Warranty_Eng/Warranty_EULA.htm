What is the procedure for resolving disputes?</EM>

<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1087936"></A>ALL DISPUTES WITH SAMSUNG ARISING IN ANY WAY FROM THIS LIMITED WARRANTY OR THE SALE, CONDITION OR PERFORMANCE OF THE PRODUCTS SHALL BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY THROUGH FINAL AND BINDING ARBITRATION, AND NOT BY A COURT OR JURY. </P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1087937"></A>Any such dispute shall not be combined or consolidated with a dispute involving any other person&#8217;s or entity&#8217;s Product or claim, and specifically, without limitation of the foregoing, shall not under any circumstances proceed as part of a class action. The arbitration shall be conducted before a single arbitrator, whose award may not exceed, in form or amount, the relief allowed by the applicable law. The arbitration shall be conducted according to the American Arbitration Association (AAA) Commercial Arbitration Rules applicable to consumer disputes. This arbitration provision is entered pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act. The laws of the State of Texas, without reference to its choice of laws principles, shall govern the interpretation of the Limited Warranty and all disputes that are subject to this arbitration provision.

<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1087938"></A>For any arbitration in which your total damage claims, exclusive of attorney fees and expert witness fees, are $5,000.00 or less (&#8220;Small Claim&#8221;), the arbitrator may, if you prevail, award your reasonable attorney fees, expert witness fees and costs as part of any award, but may not grant SAMSUNG its attorney fees, expert witness fees or costs unless it is determined that the claim was brought in bad faith. In a Small Claim case, you shall be required to pay no more than half of the total administrative, facility and arbitrator fees, or $50.00 of such fees, whichever is less, and SAMSUNG shall pay the remainder of such fees. Administrative, facility and arbitrator fees for arbitrations in which your total damage claims, exclusive of attorney fees and expert witness fees, exceed $5,000.00 (&#8220;Large Claim&#8221;) shall be determined according to AAA rules. In a Large Claim case, the arbitrator may grant to the prevailing party, or apportion among the parties, reasonable attorney fees, expert witness fees and costs. Judgment may be entered on the arbitrator&#8217;s award in any court of competent jurisdiction.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
